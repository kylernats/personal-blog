# Kyler Nats
**Cybersecurity Professional | M.S. in MIS Candidate | AWS CCP**

I am currently working toward my masters degree in Management Information Systems at the University of Arizona. My main focus is on cybersecurity and cloud security. I have a strong interest in solving technical problems and I enjoy the challenge of figuring out how systems work and how to keep them safe.

My background includes time spent as a cybersecurity analyst at FirstBank. During that internship I monitored security alerts and used tools like Splunk and Crowdstrike to investigate potential threats. I also helped manage user access and resolved security requests for thousands of employees. This experience gave me a great look at how a professional security team operates on a daily basis.

Right now I am working as a graduate research assistant for the MIS department where I get to work with Elasticsearch and complete a full risk management on our computer lab, adhering to the NIST 800-53 framework. I also hold an AWS Cloud Practitioner certification which has helped me understand how to apply security principles in a cloud environment.
